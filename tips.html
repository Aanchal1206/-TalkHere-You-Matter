            <h2>Self-care Tips for Mental Well-being</h2>
            <p>Taking care of your mind is just as important as taking care of your body. Here are some helpful tips for prioritizing your mental health.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tips">
            <h3>1. Practice Mindfulness</h3>
            <p>Take a few minutes each day to focus on the present moment. Practice mindfulness through breathing exercises or simple meditation to reduce stress and increase emotional awareness.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Stay Active</h3>
            <p>Engage in physical activity that you enjoy, whether itâ€™s walking, yoga, dancing, or going for a run. Exercise helps in boosting endorphins (the "feel-good" hormones).</p>
            
            <h3>3. Create a Routine</h3>
            <p>Establish a daily routine, even if it's simple. Having a consistent schedule can reduce feelings of chaos and help improve productivity.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Get Enough Sleep</h3>
            <p>Ensure youâ€™re getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine and avoid screens before sleep.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Connect with Loved Ones</h3>
            <p>Spend quality time with friends, family, or loved ones. If you're unable to meet in person, make a regular video call or phone call to stay connected.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Nourish Your Body</h3>
            <p>Eat nutritious foods that fuel your body, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Stay hydrated by drinking enough water.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Set Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Learn to say no and set boundaries with your time and energy. Overcommitting can lead to burnout, so prioritize activities that align with your values.</p>
            
            <h3>8. Unplug from Technology</h3>
            <p>Take breaks from digital devices and social media to reduce screen time. Try a "digital detox" for an hour or two each day.</p>
            
            <h3>9. Do Something Creative</h3>
            <p>Engage in creative activities like drawing, painting, journaling, or crafting. Expressing yourself creatively can be a therapeutic way to release emotions.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Practice Gratitude</h3>
            <p>Keep a gratitude journal and write down three things youâ€™re thankful for every day.</p>
            
            <h3>11. Declutter Your Space</h3>
            <p>Keep your environment organized and tidy. A clean, organized space can improve your mental clarity and reduce stress.</p>
            
            <h3>12. Engage in Relaxation Techniques</h3>
            <p>Incorporate deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery into your day to reduce tension and promote relaxation.</p>
            
            <h3>13. Treat Yourself</h3>
            <p>Set aside time for activities that you enjoy, whether it's a bath, reading a book, or watching your favorite movie.</p>
            
            <h3>14. Practice Self-Compassion</h3>
            <p>Be kind to yourself. Recognize that itâ€™s okay to make mistakes and not be perfect. Practice self-compassion when you face challenges.</p>
            
            <h3>15. Engage in Nature</h3>
            <p>Spend time outdoors in nature, whether itâ€™s a walk in the park, hiking, or simply sitting outside.</p>
